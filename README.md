## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Flexbox & Grid
- SASS (SCSS)
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Major learnings while working through this project using Grid and SASS file structure, build-in modules, and at-rules in flow-control.

### Continued development

The areas I want to focus on in future projects are using grids on more complex layouts and implement more SASS modules and rules.
